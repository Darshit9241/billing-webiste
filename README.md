# Calculator App with Firebase Realtime Database Integration

This application has been updated to use Firebase Realtime Database for data storage.

## Setting Up Firebase Realtime Database

1. Create a Firebase project at [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/)
2. Go to the Realtime Database section in the Firebase console and click "Create Database"
3. Choose a location for your database (preferably close to your users)
4. Start in test mode for development (remember to set up proper security rules before production)
5. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```
# Firebase Configuration
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.firebaseio.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
```

Replace all the placeholder values with your actual Firebase project credentials, which you can find in your Firebase project settings. Make sure to include the `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL` which is crucial for Realtime Database connections.

## Database Structure

The Realtime Database is structured as follows:

```
|-- clients
    |-- <client-id-1>
        |-- clientName: "Client Name"
        |-- products: [...]
        |-- grandTotal: 1000
        |-- paymentStatus: "pending" or "cleared"
        |-- amountPaid: 500
        |-- timestamp: 1620000000000
        |-- billMode: "full" or "half"
    |-- <client-id-2>
        |-- ...
```

## Firebase Database Rules

For development, you can use the following rules for your Realtime Database. Add them in the Firebase Console under "Realtime Database" > "Rules" tab:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true,
    "clients": {
      ".indexOn": ["timestamp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** These rules allow anyone to read and write to your database. Before deploying to production, set up more restrictive rules based on authentication.

## Troubleshooting Firebase Errors

If you encounter the error "Error loading client orders. Please try again.", try the following steps:

1. **Check Firebase Console**: Ensure your Firebase project is properly set up and the Realtime Database is created.

2. **Verify Database URL**: Make sure the `databaseURL` in `firebase/config.js` matches the URL in your Firebase project settings.

3. **Check Database Rules**: Ensure your database rules allow read/write access as shown above.

4. **Browser Console Errors**: Open your browser's developer console (F12) to see more detailed error messages.

5. **Data Structure**: If you've manually added data to the Firebase console, ensure it follows the expected structure.

6. **Reset Cache**: Try clearing your browser cache or using an incognito window.

7. **Initialize Data**: If your database is completely empty, adding a first client from the Add Products page can help initialize the database structure.

## Running the Application

1. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```
npm start
```

3. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
